# mockdown-client

## What is this?

A JavaScript module (written in TypeScript) for interfacing with the mockdown
server interface, plus some utilities for working with constraints
as well as Cassowary (`kiwi.js`).

## How do I use it?

First, compile it:

> npm run build

Then link it:

> yarn link

And finally, in any project you want to use your copy of this package:

> yarn link mockdown-client

(Instructions are more or less the same if you use `npm link`.)
